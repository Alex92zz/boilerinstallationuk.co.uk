                        <h3>Boiler SOS: Diagnosing the Problem</h3>
                        <img loading="lazy" style="max-width:400px; padding:15px; margin: 0 auto;" src="images/service/boiler-repair/repairing-home-boiler.jpg" alt="Repairing home boiler">
                        <p>
                            First things first, let's identify the culprit. Here are some common boiler breakdown symptoms:


                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>No heat or hot water:</strong> The most obvious sign, indicating a loss of
                                combustion, circulation, or control issues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Noises and leaks: </strong>Gurgling, banging, or dripping sounds point to internal
                                issues, while leaks suggest potential pipework problems.

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Low water pressure: </strong>A gauge reading below 1 bar could indicate leaks or air
                                in the system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pilot light issues: </strong>A flickering or extinguished pilot light can be caused
                                by various factors, including gas supply or ignition problems.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>DIY or SOS? Deciding When to Call the Pros</h3>
                        <img loading="lazy" style="max-width:400px; padding:15px; margin: 0 auto;" src="images/service/boiler-repair/worried-woman-calling-boiler-breakdown.jpg" alt="Worries woman calling boiler engineer">
                        <p>While some minor issues might be tackled by DIY enthusiasts (think adjusting thermostats or
                            bleeding radiators), it's crucial to understand when professional help is essential.
                            <strong>Always call a Gas Safe registered engineer for:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Gas leaks:</strong> Any suspected gas leak is a safety hazard and requires immediate
                                professional attention.</li>
                            <li><strong>Electrical faults:</strong> Tampering with electrical components can be dangerous
                                and should be left to qualified professionals.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Complex repairs: </strong>Internal boiler component issues or major system blockages
                                necessitate expert diagnosis and repair.</li>
                        </ul>
